* pipeline: contains scripts for training and inference pipelines.
* steps: contains scripts for data ingestion, preprocessing, and evaluation.
* models: contains model implementations.
* utils: contains utility functions used throughout the project.
* Dockerfile: specifies the environment for running the project.
* requirements.txt: lists all the required packages to run the project.

Getting Started
To get started, first clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
Then, install the required packages:

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
You can then run the pipeline using the following command:

arduino
Copy
python run_pipeline.py --config config.yaml
Configuration
The pipeline is configured using a YAML file. An example configuration file is provided in config.yaml. You can modify this file to suit your own needs.
